# NOTICE,
## It will say "Windows protected your PC" or "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting".,
## The app is safe, the reason it says that is because (It's not commonly downloaded, It lacks a digital signature, It's new or unverified.),
## Note this does require more downloads or me paying for a signature which I can not afford.
